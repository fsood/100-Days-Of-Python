100 Days of Python
Welcome to the 100 Days of Python challenge! This challenge is designed to help you improve your Python programming skills by coding consistently for the next 100 days. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Python or an experienced developer aiming to deepen your Python expertise, this challenge offers a structured and engaging path to enhance your skills.



How It Works
Coding Every Day: The challenge encourages you to code in Python every day for 100 consecutive days. The goal is to build a habit of consistent coding and learning.

Varied Projects: Over the course of the challenge, you'll work on a wide range of Python projects, each designed to cover different aspects of the language and programming concepts.

Skill Progression: The projects are structured in a way that gradually increases in complexity, helping you build on your skills and confidence as you go along.

Learning Resources: Alongside the projects, you're encouraged to utilize various Python learning resources like tutorials, documentation, online courses, and coding forums.

How to Participate
Fork and Clone: Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

Daily Commit: Create a new directory for each day (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) and commit your code daily. This helps you track your progress and keep the momentum going.

Project List: Each day's directory should contain a short description of the project you worked on that day, along with the code files.

Documentation: In the main directory, create a README.md file where you can document your progress, reflections, challenges faced, and what you've learned.

Share and Learn: Feel free to share your progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfPython. Engage with the community, learn from others, and seek help when needed.
